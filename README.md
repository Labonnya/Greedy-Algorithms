# **Activity Selection Problem**

The Activity Selection Problem is a classic algorithmic problem that involves selecting a maximum number of non-overlapping activities from a given list, where each activity has a start time and an end time. The goal is to find the optimal subset of activities that can be performed without any time conflicts.

# **Fractional Knapsack Problem**

The Fractional Knapsack Problem is a well-known optimization problem that involves selecting items from a given set with specified weights and values. The goal is to maximize the total value of items included in the knapsack without exceeding its maximum weight capacity. In the Fractional Knapsack Problem implementation, the fractionalKnapsack function uses a greedy approach to fill the knapsack by taking items with the highest value-to-weight ratio first. It repeatedly picks the item that fits into the remaining capacity of the knapsack optimally, either entirely or partially, until the capacity is exhausted.
